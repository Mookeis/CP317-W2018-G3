      1. Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the Design Phase, we consider the behaviour of the system and detail its design. Here, the software architecture is established, providing the framework of the various subsystems and the interaction between them. Building on the Analysis Phase, the Architecture Design introduces the corresponding interfaces of the predefined modules outlined in the previous phases. Additionally, this phase incorporates the Detailed Design which outlays the algorithms and data structures responsible for the operation of the product modules.
    </p>
    <h2 id="11purpose">
      1.1. Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Design Phase seeks to capture and document the specific data structures and workflows of the system in order to provide a detailed description of the project's design and automation. Once completed, the development team may proceed with a reliable forecast of the project's timeline and design for the Implementation Phase.
    </p>
    <h2 id="12intendedaudience">
      1.2. Intended Audience
    </h2>
    <p>
      The intended audience for Subby includes students in the Waterloo region who are either looking to sublet a place or are looking to rent their place out for a specified amount of time.
    </p>
    <h2 id="13productscope">
      1.3. Product Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      The scope of Subby is driven by the need for a "one-stop shop" for Waterloo sublets. This will be done by creating, advertising and maintaining a single website dedicated for finding and selling sublets. Achieving this will simplify an individual's search to find a place for the school year while also aiding in an individual's search for a renter. The finished product will be simple to use and easy to navigate through its various filters.

      4.1.4. Control Flow
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Data transmitted from the client will be saved in a PostgreSQL database. The client interacts with the web server, which uses the <code>django.db</code> database adapter to perform common operations such as inserting, updating, and querying data. This database adapter will also allow for the creation of data migrations to create schemas and tables as necessary in development and production. The client will not have direct database access- all communication will be handled by the web server.

      4.2 Project Deployment
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The deployment process will support starting the application on virtual server instances on Heroku. However it could run on a server using any OS that supports Python 3, as this is the runtime that Subby will use.
      </li>
      <li>Depending on the deployment configuration, the hosting server will also need to support a local Postgres database; alternatively, a separate server with a networked Postgres instance must be provided and reachable by the application server.

    <ul>
      <li>Unit testing will be done on every method that is written on each model to ensure that each model is functioning as they should be.
      </li>
      <li>Integration testing will be done by testing the controllers of each model since many cases requires working with multiple models on a single view.
      </li>
      <li>Further manual testing will be done to find any bugs or defects that may have not been originally detected.
      </li>
      <li>GUI testing will be conducted to test characteristics such as text formatting, text boxes, buttons, lists, layout, colors, fonts, font sizes, and so on.

      As discussed in the Analysis Phase, the system consists of five packages: User Package, Sublet Package, Rating Package, Favourite Package, and Report Package. Within each package diagram, we list the relevant entity objects and their corresponding methods. Additionally, each package diagram includes the control objects responsible for realizing the major use cases representing the interactions between external actors and the system.
